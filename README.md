## 🏛️ Architecture

**Data flow:**
```
User Input → Form State → Validation → useCloudCloset → Firestore + localStorage → UI
```

**Key patterns:**
- `useCloudCloset` — writes to Firestore when signed in, falls back to localStorage when offline/signed out. On first sign-in with no cloud data, seeds Firestore from localStorage.
- `ClosetContext` — single shared instance of `useCloudCloset` across the app; prevents duplicate Firestore connections.
- `ToastProvider` — global, decoupled notification system.
- `ErrorBoundary` — keyed by view; a crash in one screen resets on navigation.
